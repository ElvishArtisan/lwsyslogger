This is the README file for lwsyslogger.

Lwsyslogger is a simple syslog server system that is optimized for use with
Livewire infrastructure. It aims towards RFC-5424 compliance.

It consists of two components:

lwsyslogger(8) - The logger service. At present, only UDP message reception
                 (RFC-5426 compliant) is supported, using "traditional"
		 BSD-style messaging. See the lwsyslogger(8) and
		 lwsyslogger.conf(5) man pages for details.

send_syslog(1) - A simple GUI applet for originating test syslog messages.
                 Useful for debugging, but not much else.
